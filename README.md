# Mobile-Manufacturing-Sales-Analysis-Using-SQL


##  Project Overview
This SQL case study analyzes the sales data of a mobile manufacturing company using a structured relational schema. The goal is to derive actionable insights related to customers, products, sales trends, geography, and performance across years.

##  Schema Design
The project uses a normalized star schema consisting of:
- `Dim_Manufacturer`: Manufacturer information  
- `Dim_Model`: Mobile model linked to manufacturer  
- `Dim_Customer`: Customer details  
- `Dim_Location`: State and ZIP-level geolocation  
- `Fact_Transactions`: Transaction-level data including quantity and revenue

> All tables were created manually, as data access was not provided.

##  Tools Used
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**  
- **SQL (Advanced)** â€“ including `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `CTE`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`, `RANK()`, `LAG()`, subqueries, and window functions
